# econoMeet

econoMeet is a React application built with TypeScript. It leverages powerful libraries like Zod for schema validation, TanStack for state management, and React Hook Form for efficient form handling. The application allows users to input the number of participants, their yearly, monthly, weekly or daily rates, then the application will display a timer and a real-time total cost of the meeting.

## Description

econoMeet helps users understand the cost of meeting overload and to encourage the ethos of 'meet to do' rather than 'meet to meet again later'. econoMeet allows users to input the number of participants, their hourly rates, and the duration of the meeting. The application then calculates the total cost of the meeting. It also includes a timer feature that updates the cost in real time as the meeting progresses.

## Features
